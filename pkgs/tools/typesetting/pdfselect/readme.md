I made pdfselect, it is just like psselect. But it works with pdf files.  
It is meant as a complement of the wonderful pdfjam.  
With this tools, you can easily manipulated pdf files, quickly, without loss quality and completely from command line.

I thought someone may appreciate.

Any constructive comment is welcome.  
DQNs do not need to come.
